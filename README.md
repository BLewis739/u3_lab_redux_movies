# React Redux Middleware Practice

## Getting Started

- Fork and Clone
- npm install

## Setup

Make sure to install your required dependencies:

```sh
npm install axios redux react-redux redux-thunk
```

- Create a services folder. It should contain all of your axios requests
- Create a components folder

## Overview

You'll be building a react app utilizing the `Tmdb V3` api found **[HERE](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)**.

Sign up for an account and create an api key. Store the api key in a `.env` file for this lab. Remember react env variables must have `REACT_APP` prepending whatever you call your environment variable. You can either use `react-router` or build a single page app utilizing multiple components.

## Requirements

- Must have a list displaying either movies or tv shows
- Must have a detailed view for a single movie or tv show.

## Bonus

- Be able to search for movies or tv shows
